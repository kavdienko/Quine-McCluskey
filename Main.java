/**
 * Tester class with some sample tests and their expected outputs. You will not be turning this in, and may
 * freely modify any part of this file that you wish. We define a tester method for you that generates Verilog
 * modules of the original function (minterms) and the final cover that your ImplicantMintermTable class
 * produces. You may build a Verilog testbench to compare these two modules. Minimizing the function should not 
 * change its behavior; it should only trim the redundancy.
